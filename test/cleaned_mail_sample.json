These groups followed at least two distinct migration routes from Southeast Asia, with both lineages arriving at similar times, highlighting early maritime mobility and deep regional heritage.\nNew image sensor breaks optical limits\nA new imaging technology, the Multiscale Aperture Synthesis Imager (MASI), enables high-resolution, wide-field optical imaging without lenses or precise sensor alignment. MASI uses arrays of coded sensors to capture diffraction patterns and computational algorithms to synchronize and reconstruct images, surpassing traditional optical limits and allowing sub-micron resolution with scalable, flexible deployment.\nResurrected tissue: Mechanism that enables regeneration after extensive damage solves a 50-year-old mystery\nEpithelial tissue regeneration after severe damage relies on a subset of cells, termed DARE cells, which survive apoptosis by halting caspase activity through a membrane-tethering mechanism. These cells drive tissue repair and confer increased resistance to subsequent damage, a process that may also underlie tumor recurrence and therapy resistance. A feedback loop with NARE cells prevents excessive tissue growth.\nResearchers create world's smallest programmable, autonomous robots\nMicroscopic autonomous robots, measuring about 200 × 300 × 50 μm, have been developed with fully programmable movement, onboard computers, and temperature sensors. Powered by light and operating without external control, these durable robots can sense, remember, and respond to their environment, offering potential for cellular health monitoring and microscale manufacturing.\nA third path to explain consciousness: Biological computationalism\nBiological computationalism proposes that consciousness arises from computation uniquely realized in biological systems, characterized by hybrid discrete-continuous dynamics, scale-inseparability, and metabolic grounding. This view suggests that consciousness depends on computation deeply integrated with physical and energetic constraints, implying that replicating mind-like cognition may require new physical systems beyond conventional digital architectures.\nCompulsive behaviors may stem from too much (misguided) self-control\nCompulsive behaviors may result from excessive, misguided conscious control rather than automatic habits. Inflammation in the striatum of rats led to more goal-directed, deliberate actions instead of habitual ones. This challenges the traditional habit-based view of compulsivity and suggests that targeting neuroinflammation could offer new treatment strategies.\nDecades-long quest leads to first scholarly accurate fossil replica of 'dinosaur-killer' croc\nA scientifically accurate, life-sized replica of Deinosuchus schwimmeri, a giant Late Cretaceous crocodilian and apex predator, has been created and installed at the Tellus Science Museum. The replica, based on decades of fossil research and high-resolution 3D scans, enhances understanding of the species’ anatomy and ecological role in prehistoric southeastern U.S. ecosystems.\nSupernova from the dawn of the universe captured by James Webb Space Telescope\nThe James Webb Space Telescope detected a supernova at redshift z ≃ 7.3, corresponding to when the universe was about 730 million years old. The supernova's brightness and spectral features closely resemble those of local GRB-associated supernovae, indicating that massive stars in the early universe may have exploded similarly to those today, despite lower metallicity conditions.\nFathers' microplastics exposure tied to their children's metabolic problems\nPaternal exposure to microplastics in mice leads to metabolic dysfunction in offspring, with female progeny showing increased susceptibility to diabetes and altered gene expression linked to inflammation. These effects are associated with changes in sperm small noncoding RNAs, indicating a mechanism for transgenerational impact of environmental pollutants.\nThe chaotic 'Dracula's Chivito': Hubble reveals largest birthplace of planets ever observed\nHubble has imaged the largest known protoplanetary disk, IRAS 23077+6707, spanning nearly 400 billion miles and exhibiting chaotic, asymmetric structures with filament-like features on only one side. The disk, obscuring its central star or stars, contains 10–30 Jupiter masses of material, offering new insights into planet formation in extreme and turbulent environments.\nStudy shows the 2008 recession caused people to identify with a lower class\nThe 2008 recession led to a persistent shift in individuals' class identity, with more people identifying as lower class for years afterward. This change was not merely short-term or due to survey methods, but reflected a long-lasting psychological impact, potentially influenced by media messaging. The findings suggest that perceived loss of status may contribute to negative health and social outcomes.\nNew reactor produces clean energy and carbon nanotubes from natural gas\nA newly developed multi-pass reactor efficiently converts natural gas into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes without emitting CO\n2\n, using a closed-loop methane pyrolysis process. The system achieves an 8.7-fold increase in carbon yield and a 446-fold boost in process efficiency, with simulations indicating 75% conversion of input gas into valuable products at a 3:1 nanotube-to-hydrogen mass ratio.\nTwo ancient human species came out of Africa together, not one, suggests new study\nAnalysis of dental crown areas from Dmanisi fossils indicates the presence of two distinct hominin species, Homo georgicus and Homo caucasi, rather than a single group. This finding challenges the traditional view that only Homo erectus left Africa around 1.8 million years ago, suggesting multiple human species migrated out of Africa together.\nStudy says African penguins starved en masse off South Africa\nAfrican penguin populations off South Africa have experienced severe declines, with some colonies dropping by up to 95% in eight years, primarily due to food shortages linked to reduced sardine stocks from fishing and environmental changes. Fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs remain, and the species is now critically endangered, facing possible extinction in the wild by 2035.\nScientists boost mitochondria to burn more calories\nExperimental drugs have been developed that mildly increase mitochondrial uncoupling, prompting cells to burn more calories and fats without harming ATP production. These compounds avoid the toxicity of earlier uncouplers like DNP and may reduce oxidative stress, suggesting potential for safer obesity treatments and improved metabolic health.\nRaindrops form 'sandballs' as they roll downhill, contributing more to erosion than previously thought\nRaindrops rolling downhill on dry, sandy slopes form \"sandballs\" that transport up to 10 times more soil than the initial splash impact. These sandballs develop distinct peanut or doughnut shapes depending on velocity and spin, significantly increasing soil erosion. The findings suggest current erosion models may underestimate soil loss and highlight potential applications in granulation processes.\nEarth's growing heat imbalance driven more by clouds than air pollution, study finds\nEarth’s increasing energy imbalance, which drives global warming, is primarily due to changes in cloud behavior and reflected sunlight rather than recent shifts in air pollution. Opposing aerosol trends in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres largely offset each other, resulting in minimal net global impact from aerosols on the energy imbalance.\nArctic sea ice melt slowdown since 2012 linked to atmospheric pattern shift\nArctic sea ice melt has slowed markedly since 2012, with the decline rate dropping from 11.3% to 0.4% per decade. This slowdown is linked to a shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to its positive phase, which traps cold air in the Arctic. The trend is expected to reverse after 2030–2040, potentially leading to rapid ice loss and severe climate impacts if emissions are not reduced.\nAlzheimer's disease can be reversed in animal models to achieve full neurological recovery\nRestoring NAD\n+\nbalance in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease prevented and reversed advanced pathology and cognitive deficits, achieving full neurological recovery. The approach normalized disease biomarkers and did not raise NAD\n+\nto harmful levels. These findings suggest that Alzheimer's-related brain damage may be reversible under certain conditions.\nGlowing urine and shining bark: Scientists discover the secret visual language of deer\nWhite-tailed deer create visual signposts during mating season by rubbing trees and urinating on scrapes, which emit photoluminescence visible in ultraviolet light. These glowing markers, brighter before breeding, help deer communicate in low-light conditions, revealing a visual signaling system undetectable to humans.\nThis email is a free service of Science X Network.\nYou received this email because you subscribed to our list.\nIf you do not wish to receive such emails in the future, please\nunsubscribe here\n.\nYou are subscribed as\nmarijo.maracic@gmail.com\n.\r\n                  You may manage your subscription options from your\nScience X profile\n.\nStory previews are generated using AI and may not fully reflect the original content.\nFor the most complete and accurate information, please read the full article.\nRead the full disclaimer\n.\n© 2025 Science X.
